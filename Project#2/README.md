# Memory Hierarchy Implementation
**Project Period**: Dec 2021

This project implements a four-layer memory hierarchy to demonstrate cache memory functionality using a real-world dataset. <br><br>
## Features
- **Memory Layers**: Designed a hierarchy with L1 (1 element), L2 (16 elements), L3 (256 elements), and L4 (4096 elements).
- **Real-World Dataset**: Utilized the road name address database from the Korea Regional Information Development Institute.

- **Cache Functionality**: Implemented E-way set associative cache at the L3 layer for efficient data retrieval.

- **Cache Hit Ratio**: Calculated an approximate hit ratio of 0.68%, demonstrating the effectiveness of spatial locality in data access.
