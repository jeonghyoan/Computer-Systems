# Floating-Point Precision and Arithmetic in C
**Project Period**: Oct 2021

This project explores the limits of floating-point representation in C/C++ and demonstrates strategies for handling extremely large numbers beyond the range of built-in data types like `float` and `double`.<br><br>

## Features

### Floating-Point Limits
- Identified and printed the largest values that can be represented using `float` and `double`.<br><br>

### Handling Overflow
- Demonstrated techniques for storing and printing numbers exceeding the maximum range of built-in floating-point types.<br><br>

### Arithmetic Operations
- Implemented and tested basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) on large floating-point numbers, including edge cases and random inputs.<br><br>

### Scalability
- Ensured the solution can handle numbers far beyond the standard floating-point range using alternative approaches.<br><br>
